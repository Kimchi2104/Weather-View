## Core Features:

- Historical Data Visualization: Display historical weather data from Firebase Realtime Database based on user-selected date ranges. Each metric should have its own series
- Real-time Data Display: Display real-time data for all available sensors in a consolidated manner.
- AI-Powered Weather Forecast: Use an LLM as a tool to analyze current and past conditions to forecast weather condition.
- Alert System: Visually flag when collected data exceeds healthy boundaries.
- Customizable Data Selection: Allow users to select which data points they want to visualize (precipitation, temperature, etc.).
- Interactive Data Exploration: Implement interactive charts to zoom and pan through data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 75%, 50% -> RGB Hex #3399FF, reminiscent of a clear sky, giving a sense of clarity and reliability to the data.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 98% -> RGB Hex #F9FBFC, a very light tint of the primary color to not distract from the data visualizations.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 60%, 50% -> RGB Hex #33CCCC, a refreshing and distinct color for interactive elements and highlights, drawing attention to key features.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, for a clean and modern look.
- Use clean, line-based icons representing each weather metric (e.g., a raindrop for precipitation, a thermometer for temperature). Use the accent color for iconography.
- A clean, modern layout with a focus on data visualization. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Subtle animations for data loading and transitions to enhance user experience without being distracting.
